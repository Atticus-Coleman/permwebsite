Code Louisville Project


========================================================================================
1. A website for my music project. I wanted to create a simple, easy to read website that exhibits my past and upcoming projects. My hope is that people who are curious about my music can go to one place and find links to my music, press and future endeavors that I will be involved with.

2. Viewing this website is very straightforward. Run index.html for the easiest way to see what I am trying to accomplish. This website provides multiple links to my Soundcloud page, as well as a link to a blog that reviewed my album.
